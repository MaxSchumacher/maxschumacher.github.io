My motivation for this blog ist to force myself to do detailed research on every single problem and insight I encounter along the way so as to maximize my own learning.

I started this blog because Richard Schneems (@schneems on Twitter) recommended to document one's learning activities in a blog form so as to start discussions, interact with other learners and, in a sense, give back to the Developer community.

This is also an attempt to finally build a good an appealing blog with valuable content. I'm currently experimenting with Ghost (hosted on an EC2 instance on AWS) but am also looking at Octopress.

In terms of style and approach to writing I'll try to stick to best practices presented in the offical Rails Guides which are available here:
