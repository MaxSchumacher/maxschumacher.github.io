My motivation for this wiriting blog ist to force myself to do detailed research on every single problem I encounter along the way.Insights should be documented for others to see. Quite egocentrically I hope that this will me maximize my own learning.

I started this blog because Richard Schneems (@schneems on Twitter) recommended to document one's learning activities in a blog form so as to start discussions, interact with other learners and, in a sense, give back to the Developer community.

He makes this recommendation the first UT lecture of his:

In terms of style and approach to writing I'll try to stick to best practices presented in the offical Rails Guides which are available here:
