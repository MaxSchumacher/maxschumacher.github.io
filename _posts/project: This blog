Building and setting up my own blog has been on my to do list for quite a while. Instead of publishing articles, I've saved many of them in my Drive folder, I'll go ahead and release material in the future.

This blog is built with Jekyll, because Jekyll allows heavy modifications (E.g. I can learn something while building this blog) and it is written in Ruby. For these reasons I did not choose an easier to set up alternative such as wordpress.com or blogger.com.

This blog is hosted on Github - pages which is free, the whole sourcecode can be seen at:

https://github.com/MaxSchumacher/maxschumacher.github.io/

It did take me a while to set up and I could get more routine with the Git/Github workflow.

I'm organizing what is next for this blog in workflowy, a tool I can recommend:

please let me know if you have additional suggestions or find errors (there will be plenty of those):
